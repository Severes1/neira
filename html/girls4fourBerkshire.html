Submitted by Paul MacKenzie.
Distance: 1500 M
Conditions: 15-20 mph steady headwind gusting higher. Whitecaps for first 750 M of race course.
Comments: In the 6/7 race, Taft 7 suffered a couple of jumped slides in the second 500 as well as a loose foot stretcher they stopped to adjust. Also in that race, each Taft boat stopped a couple of strokes short of the finish line.
Thanks to Choate coaches for helping out with aligning/starting, and to all coaches and rowers for their patience dealing with some challenging conditions.">

Submitted by Paul MacKenzie.
Distance: 1500 M
Conditions: Cloudy, warm, moderate tailwind of 10-12 mph that diminished by final race. Moderate chop for first three races, less for final race. Order of racing: 3-2-1-4/5.
Comments: Berkshire doubled two rowers from 3V to 4V. Thanks to Greenwich for traveling and to the 1V and 2V girls for staying out to do a couple of 2 min. pieces after the racing.">
