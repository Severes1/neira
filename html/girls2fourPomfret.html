Conditions: Beautiful day! Mid 60s, sunny, slight tailwind, 8-10 mph, some sporadic cross wind. Girls 5th and 4th boat heat started a boat length ahead of the starting line.
Comments: Note: Pomfrets 4th boat shell was in the repair shop for the entire season and returned the morning of this regatta. This 4th boat crew had never raced before and didnt have more than 2 days on the water. They didnt have a start, were capped at a 26, and caught one crab during the last 250 meters. Soon, the 4th will be faster than the 5th, but they need more water time.">
