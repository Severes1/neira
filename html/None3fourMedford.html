Submitted by Kate Smith.
Distance: 2000m
Conditions: Powerful headwind for all races.
Comments: For a variety of reasons many crews were late to their races so they joined in the next race for their gender. Race order went 4th, 3rd, 2nd, 1st with girls events separating each race.
Thanks to DBMS and Medford for making the trip and thanks to CRI for joining in and giving us some great speed to chase after!">

Submitted by Adam Holland.
Distance: 1250m
Conditions: Strong cross tail wind from port for all races. Varying in intensity, but always quite strong, Reasonably calm water at start, choppier closer to finish line.
Comments: The 3rd boat race was started with the sterns aligned on the starting line.
Many thanks to both Dexter and Medford for strong racing, a great day on the water!">
