Distance: 1500 M
Conditions: Cloudy, warm, moderate tailwind of 10-12 mph that diminished by final race. Moderate chop for first three races, less for final race. Order of racing: 3-2-1-4/5.
Comments: Berkshire doubled two rowers from 3V to 4V. Thanks to Greenwich for traveling and to the 1V and 2V girls for staying out to do a couple of 2 min. pieces after the racing.">

Submitted by Carly Borken.
Distance: 1500
Conditions: 10 mph NNE headwind for all races. Headwind for the first 500. Straight cross wind for the middle 500 that slowed some crews down. Lighter headwind for the final 500 -- ideal finishing conditions.
Comments: Thanks to L/OL for making the trip, and to LHRC and Forman for joining our annual opening race.
There was a bang-bang finish between the G2 finishers Taft and GA. Very hard to tell even from photos, but it was determined that Taft was on the drive across the finish and nosed ahead.
Valley did not have complete boats, so they raced where we believed appropriate, but these races will not count for NEIRA qualifying">
