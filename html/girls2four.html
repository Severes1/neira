Comments: Great racing, particularly in the 1V and 2V. Short pieces afterwards. Parents pooled awesome food as the two teams hung out and got to know each other afterwards. A great day of rowing, competition and friendship.

Distance: 1500m
Conditions: Winds out of the SE, variable from 4-8mph, creating a cross tailwind from lane 1 to lane 6. Floating starts in the tailwind did mean that some events werent precisely 1500m, but all races were started very near the start line (5-10m variable between races).
Thanks to all crews for racing and giving us a great season ender at The Gunnery! We look forward to seeing you next year on Lake Waramaug!

Distance: 1500
Conditions: Mostly cloudy. High 63F. Winds S/SSE at 10-15 mph. Winds shifted during the day and picked up to provide a decent tailwind as the races progressed. Thanks to all visiting teams who made the drive and helped with traffic flow on both water and land.
Comments: Race Order: G4, G2, G1, G3, G5/6
G1: Stronger tailwind
G2: mild tailwind
G3: stronger tailwind/cross wind; delayed start with lane mixing. Started 30 meters ahead of starting line
G4: mild wind
G5 (Taft vs. Deerfield): Times were lost post regatta. Memory based on trailing launch who recalled Taft winning by approx 20 seconds. 
G5/6: Last race of the day; started 100 meters ahead of the starting line, after oars clashed and we held re-start from that spot.">

Distance: 1500m
Conditions: Variable crosswind that changed both speed and direction throughout the course of the afternoon and opened up even more in the second half of the course. Calm start for the V4 races, which eventually shifted to very strong cross headwind for the last 750.
Comments: Race order 2-4-1-3 to accommodate a Groton hot seat between 2/3. V4 race started 1.5 lengths over the line; 2V4 race 1 length over the line. In the 4V4 race, Groton caught a boat-stopping crab with 400m to go. Before the crab, race order was solidly SM, Groton, MX. Thanks to all crews for a great day of racing!">

Distance: 1500m
Conditions: Considerable NE cross/tail, variable conditions throughout the afternoon. Conditions choppy, particularly in the last 750m of the course.
Comments: Race order 4-2-3-1. 2V4 race was restarted after collision of two crews within the first 30 sec of race. 3V4 race started 2 lengths over the line, V4 race a little more than 1 length over the line. Given messy conditions at starting line, a really great job by all coxswains handling the starts. Thank you to all visiting crews for coming out today!">

Distance: 1500m
Conditions: Variable crosswind that changed both speed and direction throughout the course of the afternoon and opened up even more in the second half of the course. Calm start for the V4 races, which eventually shifted to very strong cross headwind for the last 750.
Comments: Race order 2-4-1-3 to accommodate a Groton hot seat between 2/3. V4 race started 1.5 lengths over the line; 2V4 race 1 length over the line. In the 4V4 race, Groton caught a boat-stopping crab with 400m to go. Before the crab, race order was solidly SM, Groton, MX. Thanks to all crews for a great day of racing!">

Distance: 1500
Conditions: 10 mph NNE headwind for all races. Headwind for the first 500. Straight cross wind for the middle 500 that slowed some crews down. Lighter headwind for the final 500 -- ideal finishing conditions.
Comments: Thanks to L/OL for making the trip, and to LHRC and Forman for joining our annual opening race.
There was a bang-bang finish between the G2 finishers Taft and GA. Very hard to tell even from photos, but it was determined that Taft was on the drive across the finish and nosed ahead.
Valley did not have complete boats, so they raced where we believed appropriate, but these races will not count for NEIRA qualifying">

Conditions: Beautiful day! Mid 60s, sunny, slight tailwind, 8-10 mph, some sporadic cross wind. Girls 5th and 4th boat heat started a boat length ahead of the starting line.
Comments: Note: Pomfrets 4th boat shell was in the repair shop for the entire season and returned the morning of this regatta. This 4th boat crew had never raced before and didnt have more than 2 days on the water. They didnt have a start, were capped at a 26, and caught one crab during the last 250 meters. Soon, the 4th will be faster than the 5th, but they need more water time.">

Conditions: Winds out of the SE, variable from 4-8mph, creating a cross tailwind from lane 1 to lane 6. Floating starts in the tailwind did mean that some events werent precisely 1500m, but all races were started very near the start line (5-10m variable between races).

Distance: 1300m
Conditions: 15mph headwind with some chop in the first half, increaing in intensity over the course of the afternoon. Order of racing was 4, 3, 2, 1, 5 with best conditions for the first two races.
Comments: Choate 4 and 5 raced Lincolns 4th boat, and Choate 6 and 7 raced Lincolns 5th boat. Choate 7 caught a boat-stopping crab at 500m into the race. It took about 30 seconds to recover the oar and to turn the boat back to the correct direction. Before the crab, Choate 7 was trailing Lincoln 5 and Choate 6 by about half a length.">

Distance: 1500 M
Conditions: 15-20 mph steady headwind gusting higher. Whitecaps for first 750 M of race course.
Comments: In the 6/7 race, Taft 7 suffered a couple of jumped slides in the second 500 as well as a loose foot stretcher they stopped to adjust. Also in that race, each Taft boat stopped a couple of strokes short of the finish line.
Thanks to Choate coaches for helping out with aligning/starting, and to all coaches and rowers for their patience dealing with some challenging conditions.">

Distance: 1500m
Conditions: Winds out of the SE, variable from 4-8mph, creating a cross tailwind from lane 1 to lane 6. Floating starts in the tailwind did mean that some events werent precisely 1500m, but all races were started very near the start line (5-10m variable between races).
Thanks to all crews for racing and giving us a great season ender at The Gunnery! We look forward to seeing you next year on Lake Waramaug!

Distance: 1500m
Conditions: Conditions were pretty good. Winds out of the SW at 5-7 mph, creating a crosstail from lanes 6 to lane 1. Coxes had some trouble staying in lanes at the start, but overall rowers handled the conditions very well. Racing order: 4-3-2-1-5.

Distance: 1500
Conditions: Mostly cloudy. High 63F. Winds S/SSE at 10-15 mph. Winds shifted during the day and picked up to provide a decent tailwind as the races progressed. Thanks to all visiting teams who made the drive and helped with traffic flow on both water and land.
Comments: Race Order: G4, G2, G1, G3, G5/6
G1: Stronger tailwind
G2: mild tailwind
G3: stronger tailwind/cross wind; delayed start with lane mixing. Started 30 meters ahead of starting line
G4: mild wind
G5 (Taft vs. Deerfield): Times were lost post regatta. Memory based on trailing launch who recalled Taft winning by approx 20 seconds. 
G5/6: Last race of the day; started 100 meters ahead of the starting line, after oars clashed and we held re-start from that spot.">
