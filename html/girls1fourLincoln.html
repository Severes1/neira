Submitted by Pomfret School .
Distance: 1500
Conditions: Beautiful day! Mid 60s, sunny, slight tailwind, 8-10 mph, some sporadic cross wind. Girls 5th and 4th boat heat started a boat length ahead of the starting line.
Comments: Note: Pomfrets 4th boat shell was in the repair shop for the entire season and returned the morning of this regatta. This 4th boat crew had never raced before and didnt have more than 2 days on the water. They didnt have a start, were capped at a 26, and caught one crab during the last 250 meters. Soon, the 4th will be faster than the 5th, but they need more water time.">

Submitted by Libby Boghossian.
Distance: 1300m
Conditions: 15mph headwind with some chop in the first half, increaing in intensity over the course of the afternoon. Order of racing was 4, 3, 2, 1, 5 with best conditions for the first two races.
Comments: Choate 4 and 5 raced Lincolns 4th boat, and Choate 6 and 7 raced Lincolns 5th boat. Choate 7 caught a boat-stopping crab at 500m into the race. It took about 30 seconds to recover the oar and to turn the boat back to the correct direction. Before the crab, Choate 7 was trailing Lincoln 5 and Choate 6 by about half a length.">
