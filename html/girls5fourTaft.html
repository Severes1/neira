Conditions: Mostly cloudy. High 63F. Winds S/SSE at 10-15 mph. Winds shifted during the day and picked up to provide a decent tailwind as the races progressed. Thanks to all visiting teams who made the drive and helped with traffic flow on both water and land.
Comments: Race Order: G4, G2, G1, G3, G5/6
G1: Stronger tailwind
G2: mild tailwind
G3: stronger tailwind/cross wind; delayed start with lane mixing. Started 30 meters ahead of starting line
G4: mild wind
G5 (Taft vs. Deerfield): Times were lost post regatta. Memory based on trailing launch who recalled Taft winning by approx 20 seconds. 
G5/6: Last race of the day; started 100 meters ahead of the starting line, after oars clashed and we held re-start from that spot.">

There was a bang-bang finish between the G2 finishers Taft and GA. Very hard to tell even from photos, but it was determined that Taft was on the drive across the finish and nosed ahead.

Submitted by Pomfret School .
Distance: 1500
Conditions: Mostly cloudy. High 63F. Winds S/SSE at 10-15 mph. Winds shifted during the day and picked up to provide a decent tailwind as the races progressed. Thanks to all visiting teams who made the drive and helped with traffic flow on both water and land.
Comments: Race Order: G4, G2, G1, G3, G5/6
G1: Stronger tailwind
G2: mild tailwind
G3: stronger tailwind/cross wind; delayed start with lane mixing. Started 30 meters ahead of starting line
G4: mild wind
G5 (Taft vs. Deerfield): Times were lost post regatta. Memory based on trailing launch who recalled Taft winning by approx 20 seconds. 
G5/6: Last race of the day; started 100 meters ahead of the starting line, after oars clashed and we held re-start from that spot.">

Submitted by Paul MacKenzie.
Distance: 1500 M
Conditions: 15-20 mph steady headwind gusting higher. Whitecaps for first 750 M of race course.
Comments: In the 6/7 race, Taft 7 suffered a couple of jumped slides in the second 500 as well as a loose foot stretcher they stopped to adjust. Also in that race, each Taft boat stopped a couple of strokes short of the finish line.
Thanks to Choate coaches for helping out with aligning/starting, and to all coaches and rowers for their patience dealing with some challenging conditions.">

Submitted by Carly Borken.
Distance: 1500
Conditions: 10 mph NNE headwind for all races. Headwind for the first 500. Straight cross wind for the middle 500 that slowed some crews down. Lighter headwind for the final 500 -- ideal finishing conditions.
Comments: Thanks to L/OL for making the trip, and to LHRC and Forman for joining our annual opening race.
There was a bang-bang finish between the G2 finishers Taft and GA. Very hard to tell even from photos, but it was determined that Taft was on the drive across the finish and nosed ahead.
Valley did not have complete boats, so they raced where we believed appropriate, but these races will not count for NEIRA qualifying">

Submitted by Melissa Schomers.
Distance: 1500m
Conditions: Conditions were pretty good. Winds out of the SW at 5-7 mph, creating a crosstail from lanes 6 to lane 1. Coxes had some trouble staying in lanes at the start, but overall rowers handled the conditions very well. Racing order: 4-3-2-1-5.
Congratulations to Taft for winning the Alumni Cup with 6 points, winning the tie over The Gunnery with a win in the G1V4.
