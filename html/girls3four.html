Distance: 1500m
Conditions: Conditions were pretty good. Winds out of the SW at 5&#45;7 mph, creating a crosstail from lanes 6 to lane 1. Coxes had some trouble staying in lanes at the start, but overall rowers handled the conditions very well. Racing order: 4&#45;3&#45;2&#45;1&#45;5.
Congratulations to Taft for winning the Alumni Cup with 6 points, winning the tie over The Gunnery with a win in the G1V4.

Distance: 1500m
Conditions: Winds out of the SE, variable from 4&#45;8mph, creating a cross tailwind from lane 1 to lane 6. Floating starts in the tailwind did mean that some events werent precisely 1500m, but all races were started very near the start line (5&#45;10m variable between races).
Thanks to all crews for racing and giving us a great season ender at The Gunnery! We look forward to seeing you next year on Lake Waramaug!

Comments: Race order 2, 1, 3/4. 
In the 1st boat race, Southfields stroke seats oar popped out of its oarlock 2:54 into the race. At that point, NCDS was up by 2 seats. After approx. 5 recovery time, Southfield came back and rowed an aggressive, tenacious race to the finish.
Thank you to Southfield for a great afternoon of early season racing on the Charles!" alt="" coords="538,998,569,1011,599,1027,611,1038,618,1049,625,1058,637,1067,682,1084,720,1087,760,1087,810,1091,846,1096,845,1102,809,1096,759,1092,720,1093,681,1089,635,1072,622,1062,614,1052,607,1041,596,1032,567,1016,536,1003"/>

Conditions: Head current, tailwind for all races.
Comments: Race order 2, 1, 3/4. 
In the 1st boat race, Southfields stroke seats oar popped out of its oarlock 2:54 into the race. At that point, NCDS was up by 2 seats. After approx. 5 recovery time, Southfield came back and rowed an aggressive, tenacious race to the finish.
Thank you to Southfield for a great afternoon of early season racing on the Charles!" alt="" coords="1007,1135,1231,1203,1351,1234,1350,1239,1230,1208,1005,1140"/>
