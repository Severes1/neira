Submitted by Libby Boghossian.
Distance: 1300m
Conditions: 15mph headwind with some chop in the first half, increaing in intensity over the course of the afternoon. Order of racing was 4, 3, 2, 1, 5 with best conditions for the first two races.
Comments: Choate 4 and 5 raced Lincolns 4th boat, and Choate 6 and 7 raced Lincolns 5th boat. Choate 7 caught a boat-stopping crab at 500m into the race. It took about 30 seconds to recover the oar and to turn the boat back to the correct direction. Before the crab, Choate 7 was trailing Lincoln 5 and Choate 6 by about half a length.">
