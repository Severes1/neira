Submitted by Pomfret coaching staff.
Distance: 1,500 Meters
Conditions: Near ideal conditions: barely a breeze with flat water for early races, switching to a stronger cross-tailwind with very light chop for the B4 on. No current. Partly sunny.
Comments: Races alternated with girls races. Order of racing: 2:30 start, B5-G4-B6-G2-B2-G1-B3-G3-B4-G5-B1-G6 on 10-minute centers, ending at 4:40 pm. Winds shifted most noticeably with the G3 race at 3:40 pm.
Due to the sudden shift to a light/moderate tailwind, the following races started over the line by the following distance: 
- B4: 30 meters over, ~1470 m total.
- B1: 10 meters over, ~1490 m total.
Due to illness, Taft raced a 1, 2, 3, and 5 boat.">

Submitted by Melissa Schomers.
Distance: 1500m
Conditions: Winds out of the SW, creating a cross-tail from lane 1 to lane 6. Floating starts. Tailwind shifted the distance for some events as they drifted past the starting line, but all crews started within 5-15m of the start. A faulty stopwatch resulted in time not being taken for the Gunnery 3V4, but it is estimated they finished 20-30 seconds behind the 3rd place crew.
Thanks to all crews for racing us on our season ender at Lake Waramaug! We look forward to seeing everyone again next year!

Submitted by Deerfield Coaching Staff.
Distance: 1500m
Conditions: Solid cross wind in the first 750 that swung to a cross headwind in the second 750. Wind strength was variable. Tail current. Some crews started on the line and others slightly over. Times should not be compared between events. Order of racing - 5V, 6V, 3V, 2V, 1V, 4V.
Comments: There was some great racing today on the Connecticut River. Thanks to Nobles, Middlesex, and Rumsey Hall for making the trip out to Northampton. And thank you to UMass and Northampton Community Rowing for helping us to host the event!">
