Submitted by Pomfret coaching staff.
Distance: 1,500 Meters
Conditions: Near ideal conditions: barely a breeze with flat water for early races, switching to a stronger cross-tailwind with very light chop for the B4 on. No current. Partly sunny.
Comments: Races alternated with girls races. Order of racing: 2:30 start, B5-G4-B6-G2-B2-G1-B3-G3-B4-G5-B1-G6 on 10-minute centers, ending at 4:40 pm. Winds shifted most noticeably with the G3 race at 3:40 pm.
Due to the sudden shift to a light/moderate tailwind, the following races started over the line by the following distance: 
- B4: 30 meters over, ~1470 m total.
- B1: 10 meters over, ~1490 m total.
Due to illness, Taft raced a 1, 2, 3, and 5 boat.">
