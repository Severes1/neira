Submitted by Liz Cavanaugh.
Distance: 1500m
Conditions: Significant cross tail that was somewhat variable throughout the afternoon but the calmest for the V4 races. Moderate chop throughout the entire course.
Comments: Race order 4-2-3-1. 4V4 started 2 lengths over the line, 2V4 started 1 length over the line. Quick starts due to windy conditions. Great racing by all crews - thank you to our visiting teams for coming on a busy Quinsigamond Saturday!">

Comments: Thanks to L/OL for making the trip, and to LHRC and Forman for joining our annual opening race.
There was a bang-bang finish between the G2 finishers Taft and GA. Very hard to tell even from photos, but it was determined that Taft was on the drive across the finish and nosed ahead.
Valley did not have complete boats, so they raced where we believed appropriate, but these races will not count for NEIRA qualifying">
