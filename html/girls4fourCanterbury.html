Distance: 1500
Conditions: Floating starts with moderate head winds early in the races but dying as the afternoon went on. It was against the current.
Comments: The start was 6K away from the dock which made hot seating challenging but doable. GA hot seated a rower from GV4 to GV3 . A time wasnt recorded for Greenwich A in GV4.">
