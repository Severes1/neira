Submitted by Melissa Schomers.
Distance: 1500m
Conditions: Winds out of the SW, creating a cross-tail from lane 1 to lane 6. Floating starts. Tailwind shifted the distance for some events as they drifted past the starting line, but all crews started within 5-15m of the start. A faulty stopwatch resulted in time not being taken for the Gunnery 3V4, but it is estimated they finished 20-30 seconds behind the 3rd place crew.
Thanks to all crews for racing us on our season ender at Lake Waramaug! We look forward to seeing everyone again next year!
