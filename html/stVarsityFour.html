Distance: 2000m
Conditions: Powerful headwind for all races.
Comments: For a variety of reasons many crews were late to their races so they joined in the next race for their gender. Race order went 4th, 3rd, 2nd, 1st with girls events separating each race.
Thanks to DBMS and Medford for making the trip and thanks to CRI for joining in and giving us some great speed to chase after!">
