Distance: 1500m
Conditions: Considerable NE cross/tail, variable conditions throughout the afternoon. Conditions choppy, particularly in the last 750m of the course.
Comments: Race order 4&#45;2&#45;3&#45;1. 2V4 race was restarted after collision of two crews within the first 30 sec of race. 3V4 race started 2 lengths over the line, V4 race a little more than 1 length over the line.

Conditions: Variable crosswind that changed both speed and direction throughout the course of the afternoon and opened up even more in the second half of the course. Calm start for the V4 races, which eventually shifted to very strong cross headwind for the last 750.
Comments: Race order 2&#45;4&#45;1&#45;3 to accommodate a Groton hot seat between 2/3. V4 race started 1.5 lengths over the line; 2V4 race 1 length over the line.

Comments: Race order 4&#45;2&#45;3&#45;1. 2V4 race was restarted after collision of two crews within the first 30 sec of race. 3V4 race started 2 lengths over the line, V4 race a little more than 1 length over the line. Given messy conditions at starting line, a really great job by all coxswains handling the starts.

Conditions: Winds out of the SE, variable from 4&#45;8mph, creating a cross tailwind from lane 1 to lane 6. Floating starts in the tailwind did mean that some events werent precisely 1500m, but all races were started very near the start line (5&#45;10m variable between races).
Thanks to all crews for racing and giving us a great season ender at The Gunnery! We look forward to seeing you next year on Lake Waramaug!

Distance: 1500m
Conditions: Conditions were pretty good. Winds out of the SW at 5&#45;7 mph, creating a crosstail from lanes 6 to lane 1. Coxes had some trouble staying in lanes at the start, but overall rowers handled the conditions very well. Racing order: 4&#45;3&#45;2&#45;1&#45;5.
Congratulations to Taft for winning the Alumni Cup with 6 points, winning the tie over The Gunnery with a win in the G1V4.

Comments: Great racing, particularly in the 1V and 2V. Short pieces afterwards. Parents pooled awesome food as the two teams hung out and got to know each other afterwards. A great day of rowing, competition and friendship. Great thanks to UMass, Smith, Amherst and Northampton Community Rowing for making their amazing water available to us, and particularly to NCR and Todd Gocken for hosting." alt="" coords="2228,1002,2273,1040,2294,1064,2310,1092,2332,1144,2341,1174,2346,1205,2346,1238,2338,1272,2321,1308,2294,1343,2275,1353,2239,1363,2120,1387,1762,1438,1364,1486,1068,1519,1067,1514,1363,1481,1762,1433,2119,1381,2237,1358,2273,1348,2290,1339,2317,1305,2333,1271,2340,1238,2341,1205,2335,1175,2327,1146,2306,1095,2290,1068,2270,1044,2225,1006"/>

G4: mild wind
G5 (Taft vs. Deerfield): Times were lost post regatta. Memory based on trailing launch who recalled Taft winning by approx 20 seconds. 
G5/6: Last race of the day; started 100 meters ahead of the starting line, after oars clashed and we held re&#45;start from that spot." alt="" coords="256,462,225,538,208,589,195,645,188,704,190,763,204,818,216,844,233,868,244,879,255,884,280,886,308,884,341,891,385,912,419,934,473,980,528,1025,562,1046,605,1067,696,1087,851,1113,1006,1140,1063,1152,1097,1163,1111,1173,1119,1184,1126,1194,1138,1203,1199,1220,1286,1233,1468,1246,1467,1252,1285,1238,1198,1225,1136,1208,1122,1198,1114,1187,1107,1177,1095,1168,1062,1157,1005,1145,850,1118,695,1092,603,1072,559,1051,524,1029,470,984,416,939,382,917,339,896,308,889,280,891,254,889,241,883,229,871,212,846,199,820,185,763,183,704,190,644,203,587,220,536,252,460"/>

Conditions: Head current, tailwind for all races.
Comments: Race order 2, 1, 3/4. 
In the 1st boat race, Southfields stroke seats oar popped out of its oarlock 2:54 into the race. At that point, NCDS was up by 2 seats. After approx. 5 recovery time, Southfield came back and rowed an aggressive, tenacious race to the finish.
Thank you to Southfield for a great afternoon of early season racing on the Charles!" alt="" coords="1850,1142,1694,1208,1609,1236,1607,1231,1692,1203,1848,1137"/>

Distance: 1500
Conditions: 10 mph NNE headwind for all races. Headwind for the first 500. Straight cross wind for the middle 500 that slowed some crews down. Lighter headwind for the final 500 &#45;&#45; ideal finishing conditions.
Comments: Thanks to L/OL for making the trip, and to LHRC and Forman for joining our annual opening race.
There was a bang&#45;bang finish between the G2 finishers Taft and GA. Very hard to tell even from photos, but it was determined that Taft was on the drive across the finish and nosed ahead.
Valley did not have complete boats, so they raced where we believed appropriate, but these races will not count for NEIRA qualifying" alt="" coords="1181,1143,1167,1175,1145,1207,1126,1223,1105,1235,1103,1231,1123,1218,1141,1204,1162,1173,1176,1141"/>
