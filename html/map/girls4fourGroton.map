Distance: 1500m
Conditions: Variable crosswind that changed both speed and direction throughout the course of the afternoon and opened up even more in the second half of the course. Calm start for the V4 races, which eventually shifted to very strong cross headwind for the last 750.

Distance: 1500
Conditions: Mostly cloudy. High 63F. Winds S/SSE at 10&#45;15 mph. Winds shifted during the day and picked up to provide a decent tailwind as the races progressed. Thanks to all visiting teams who made the drive and helped with traffic flow on both water and land.
Comments: Race Order: G4, G2, G1, G3, G5/6
G1: Stronger tailwind
G2: mild tailwind
G3: stronger tailwind/cross wind; delayed start with lane mixing. Started 30 meters ahead of starting line
G4: mild wind
G5 (Taft vs. Deerfield): Times were lost post regatta. Memory based on trailing launch who recalled Taft winning by approx 20 seconds.
