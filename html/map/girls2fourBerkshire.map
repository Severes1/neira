Conditions: Cloudy, warm, moderate tailwind of 10&#45;12 mph that diminished by final race. Moderate chop for first three races, less for final race. Order of racing: 3&#45;2&#45;1&#45;4/5.

Conditions: Conditions were pretty good. Winds out of the SW at 5&#45;7 mph, creating a crosstail from lanes 6 to lane 1. Coxes had some trouble staying in lanes at the start, but overall rowers handled the conditions very well. Racing order: 4&#45;3&#45;2&#45;1&#45;5.
