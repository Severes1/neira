Submitted by Andrew Bagley.
Distance: 1500m
Conditions: Considerable NE cross/tail, variable conditions through the afternoon. Conditions choppy, particularly in the last 750m of the course.
Comments: Race order 2&#45;3/4&#45;1. 3V/4V race was started 3 lengths over the line due to the considerable winds causing the boats to drift past. 2V/1V races all started at the 1500m mark. Well done coxswains for handling the difficult conditions and thank you to all visiting schools for joining!" alt="" coords="113,18,133,20,143,29,138,37,127,40,125,35,135,32,138,30,131,25,112,23"/>
