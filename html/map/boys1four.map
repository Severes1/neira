Distance: 1500
Conditions: Floating starts with moderate head winds early in the races but dying as the afternoon went on. It was against the current.
Comments: The crews launched 6K from the start so hot seating was challenging but done. Dexter 2v hot seated a rower from 5v. 2 rowers from Dexter 1v finished and then raced in the 2v due to illness and injury. Dexter 4v raced without a skeg. Hopkins protested the 1V as Brunswick crossed into their lane around 750 and gave them rougher waters to row. Overall it was great race conditions and a great day of close races.

Conditions: Good racing conditions, though it was challenging for coxes at the starting line. Winds out of the SW at 5&#45;10mph, creating a cross&#45;tail wind from lane 6 to lane 1. Some crews had trouble locking on, but overall, crews did an excellent job in the conditions.
Congratulations to Taft for winning the Smith cup with their win in the B1V4 event.

Distance: 1500m
Conditions: Winds out of the SW, creating a cross&#45;tail from lane 1 to lane 6. Floating starts. Tailwind shifted the distance for some events as they drifted past the starting line, but all crews started within 5&#45;15m of the start. A faulty stopwatch resulted in time not being taken for the Gunnery 3V4, but it is estimated they finished 20&#45;30 seconds behind the 3rd place crew.

Distance: 1,500 Meters
Conditions: Near ideal conditions: barely a breeze with flat water for early races, switching to a stronger cross&#45;tailwind with very light chop for the B4 on. No current. Partly sunny.
Comments: Races alternated with girls races. Order of racing: 2:30 start, B5&#45;G4&#45;B6&#45;G2&#45;B2&#45;G1&#45;B3&#45;G3&#45;B4&#45;G5&#45;B1&#45;G6 on 10&#45;minute centers, ending at 4:40 pm. Winds shifted most noticeably with the G3 race at 3:40 pm.
Due to the sudden shift to a light/moderate tailwind, the following races started over the line by the following distance: 
&#45; B4: 30 meters over, ~1470 m total.
&#45; B1: 10 meters over, ~1490 m total.

Distance: 1500m
Conditions: Winds out of the SW, creating a cross&#45;tail from lane 1 to lane 6. Floating starts. Tailwind shifted the distance for some events as they drifted past the starting line, but all crews started within 5&#45;15m of the start. A faulty stopwatch resulted in time not being taken for the Gunnery 3V4, but it is estimated they finished 20&#45;30 seconds behind the 3rd place crew.

Distance: 1500m
Conditions: Good racing conditions, though it was challenging for coxes at the starting line. Winds out of the SW at 5&#45;10mph, creating a cross&#45;tail wind from lane 6 to lane 1. Some crews had trouble locking on, but overall, crews did an excellent job in the conditions.
Congratulations to Taft for winning the Smith cup with their win in the B1V4 event.
