Distance: 1500m
Conditions: Significant cross tail that was somewhat variable throughout the afternoon but the calmest for the V4 races. Moderate chop throughout the entire course.
Comments: Race order 4&#45;2&#45;3&#45;1. 4V4 started 2 lengths over the line, 2V4 started 1 length over the line. Quick starts due to windy conditions. Great racing by all crews &#45; thank you to our visiting teams for coming on a busy Quinsigamond Saturday!" alt="" coords="171,49,328,115,408,143,407,148,326,120,169,54"/>
