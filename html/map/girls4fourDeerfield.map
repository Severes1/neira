Submitted by Melissa Schomers.
Distance: 1500m
Conditions: Winds out of the SE, variable from 4&#45;8mph, creating a cross tailwind from lane 1 to lane 6. Floating starts in the tailwind did mean that some events werent precisely 1500m, but all races were started very near the start line (5&#45;10m variable between races).
Thanks to all crews for racing and giving us a great season ender at The Gunnery! We look forward to seeing you next year on Lake Waramaug!
