Conditions: Cross tail and full tail variable throughout races. Race order was 3&#45;2&#45;4&#45;1&#45;5, with 20 minute centers.
Comments: G3, over line about a deck, G2 over the line by length,Girls 4th over line by 1/2 deck, Girls 1st almost a length over the line, 5th slightly over line. Some coxswain steering issues but none that effected the outcomes.

Submitted by Melissa Schomers.
Distance: 1500m
Conditions: Winds out of the SE, variable from 4&#45;8mph, creating a cross tailwind from lane 1 to lane 6. Floating starts in the tailwind did mean that some events werent precisely 1500m, but all races were started very near the start line (5&#45;10m variable between races).
Thanks to all crews for racing and giving us a great season ender at The Gunnery! We look forward to seeing you next year on Lake Waramaug!

Distance: 1500m
Conditions: Considerable NE cross/tail, variable conditions throughout the afternoon. Conditions choppy, particularly in the last 750m of the course.
Comments: Race order 4&#45;2&#45;3&#45;1. 2V4 race was restarted after collision of two crews within the first 30 sec of race. 3V4 race started 2 lengths over the line, V4 race a little more than 1 length over the line.

Submitted by Pomfret School .
Distance: 1500
Conditions: Mostly cloudy. High 63F. Winds S/SSE at 10&#45;15 mph. Winds shifted during the day and picked up to provide a decent tailwind as the races progressed. Thanks to all visiting teams who made the drive and helped with traffic flow on both water and land.
Comments: Race Order: G4, G2, G1, G3, G5/6
G1: Stronger tailwind
G2: mild tailwind
G3: stronger tailwind/cross wind; delayed start with lane mixing. Started 30 meters ahead of starting line
G4: mild wind
G5 (Taft vs. Deerfield): Times were lost post regatta. Memory based on trailing launch who recalled Taft winning by approx 20 seconds. 
G5/6: Last race of the day; started 100 meters ahead of the starting line, after oars clashed and we held re&#45;start from that spot." alt="" coords="710,53,666,86,612,120,543,148,541,143,609,115,663,82,707,49"/>
