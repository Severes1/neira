Submitted by Pomfret coaching staff.
Distance: 1,500 Meters
Conditions: Near ideal conditions: barely a breeze with flat water for early races, switching to a stronger cross&#45;tailwind with very light chop for the B4 on. No current. Partly sunny.
Comments: Races alternated with girls races. Order of racing: 2:30 start, B5&#45;G4&#45;B6&#45;G2&#45;B2&#45;G1&#45;B3&#45;G3&#45;B4&#45;G5&#45;B1&#45;G6 on 10&#45;minute centers, ending at 4:40 pm. Winds shifted most noticeably with the G3 race at 3:40 pm.
Due to the sudden shift to a light/moderate tailwind, the following races started over the line by the following distance: 
&#45; B4: 30 meters over, ~1470 m total.
&#45; B1: 10 meters over, ~1490 m total.
Due to illness, Taft raced a 1, 2, 3, and 5 boat." alt="" coords="286,47,198,80,145,109,97,139,94,135,142,104,196,75,284,42"/>

Submitted by Melissa Schomers.
Distance: 1500m
Conditions: Winds out of the SW, creating a cross&#45;tail from lane 1 to lane 6. Floating starts. Tailwind shifted the distance for some events as they drifted past the starting line, but all crews started within 5&#45;15m of the start. A faulty stopwatch resulted in time not being taken for the Gunnery 3V4, but it is estimated they finished 20&#45;30 seconds behind the 3rd place crew.
Thanks to all crews for racing us on our season ender at Lake Waramaug! We look forward to seeing everyone again next year!
