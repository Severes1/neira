Distance: 1,500 Meters

Due to the sudden shift to a light/moderate tailwind, the following races started over the line by the following distance:

Distance: 1500
Conditions: 7&#45;9 mph headwind. Little current, but heavy chop for the first three races (GN, B2V, BN and B3V). Moderate chop for the last three events (G2V, G1V and B1V)
Comments: In the boys 1V race, Dexter impeded Dublin. This was caused by the drifting of the 500m buoy from lanes 3/4 to lanes 2/3. Dublin lodged a protest at the finish. It was decided that it was inconclusive as to whether the order of finish would have been impacted.
