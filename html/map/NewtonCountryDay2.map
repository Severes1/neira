Conditions: Steady tail current. No wind. Flat water. Gorgeous conditions.
Comments: Great racing, particularly in the 1V and 2V. Short pieces afterwards. Parents pooled awesome food as the two teams hung out and got to know each other afterwards. A great day of rowing, competition and friendship. Great thanks to UMass, Smith, Amherst and Northampton Community Rowing for making their amazing water available to us, and particularly to NCR and Todd Gocken for hosting." alt="" coords="696,53,645,86,584,120,526,143,524,138,581,115,642,82,693,49"/>
