Submitted by Sarah Bednar.
Distance: 1500
Conditions: Floating starts with moderate head winds early in the races but dying as the afternoon went on. It was against the current.
Comments: The crews launched 6K from the start so hot seating was challenging but done. Dexter 2v hot seated a rower from 5v. 2 rowers from Dexter 1v finished and then raced in the 2v due to illness and injury. Dexter 4v raced without a skeg. Hopkins protested the 1V as Brunswick crossed into their lane around 750 and gave them rougher waters to row. Overall it was great race conditions and a great day of close races. Races were rowed in the order listed and alternated male and female." alt="" coords="1171,51,1211,85,1263,115,1343,140,1426,154,1425,160,1342,145,1260,120,1208,89,1167,55"/>

Submitted by Pomfret coaching staff.
Distance: 1,500 Meters
Conditions: Near ideal conditions: barely a breeze with flat water for early races, switching to a stronger cross&#45;tailwind with very light chop for the B4 on. No current. Partly sunny.
Comments: Races alternated with girls races. Order of racing: 2:30 start, B5&#45;G4&#45;B6&#45;G2&#45;B2&#45;G1&#45;B3&#45;G3&#45;B4&#45;G5&#45;B1&#45;G6 on 10&#45;minute centers, ending at 4:40 pm. Winds shifted most noticeably with the G3 race at 3:40 pm.
Due to the sudden shift to a light/moderate tailwind, the following races started over the line by the following distance: 
&#45; B4: 30 meters over, ~1470 m total.
&#45; B1: 10 meters over, ~1490 m total.
