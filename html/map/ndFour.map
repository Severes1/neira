Distance: 1250m
Conditions: Strong cross tail wind from port for all races. Varying in intensity, but always quite strong, Reasonably calm water at start, choppier closer to finish line.
Comments: The 3rd boat race was started with the sterns aligned on the starting line.
Many thanks to both Dexter and Medford for strong racing, a great day on the water!" alt="" coords="60,188,80,252,85,264,81,266,75,254,55,190"/>
