Distance: 1300m
Conditions: 15mph headwind with some chop in the first half, increaing in intensity over the course of the afternoon. Order of racing was 4, 3, 2, 1, 5 with best conditions for the first two races.
Comments: Choate 4 and 5 raced Lincolns 4th boat, and Choate 6 and 7 raced Lincolns 5th boat. Choate 7 caught a boat&#45;stopping crab at 500m into the race. It took about 30 seconds to recover the oar and to turn the boat back to the correct direction. Before the crab, Choate 7 was trailing Lincoln 5 and Choate 6 by about half a length." alt="" coords="242,181,201,195,159,216,121,242,88,271,85,267,118,238,156,211,199,190,241,176"/>

Distance: 1500 M
Conditions: 15&#45;20 mph steady headwind gusting higher. Whitecaps for first 750 M of race course.
Comments: In the 6/7 race, Taft 7 suffered a couple of jumped slides in the second 500 as well as a loose foot stretcher they stopped to adjust. Also in that race, each Taft boat stopped a couple of strokes short of the finish line.
Thanks to Choate coaches for helping out with aligning/starting, and to all coaches and rowers for their patience dealing with some challenging conditions." alt="" coords="264,189,238,215,193,270,189,267,234,212,260,185"/>

Distance: 1500m
Conditions: Winds out of the SE, variable from 4&#45;8mph, creating a cross tailwind from lane 1 to lane 6. Floating starts in the tailwind did mean that some events werent precisely 1500m, but all races were started very near the start line (5&#45;10m variable between races).
Thanks to all crews for racing and giving us a great season ender at The Gunnery! We look forward to seeing you next year on Lake Waramaug!
