Conditions: Considerable NE cross/tail, variable conditions throughout the afternoon. Conditions choppy, particularly in the last 750m of the course.
Comments: Race order 4&#45;2&#45;3&#45;1. 2V4 race was restarted after collision of two crews within the first 30 sec of race. 3V4 race started 2 lengths over the line, V4 race a little more than 1 length over the line.

Conditions: Variable crosswind that changed both speed and direction throughout the course of the afternoon and opened up even more in the second half of the course. Calm start for the V4 races, which eventually shifted to very strong cross headwind for the last 750.
Comments: Race order 2&#45;4&#45;1&#45;3 to accommodate a Groton hot seat between 2/3. V4 race started 1.5 lengths over the line; 2V4 race 1 length over the line.

Submitted by Liz Cavanaugh.
Distance: 1500m
Conditions: Variable crosswind that changed both speed and direction throughout the course of the afternoon and opened up even more in the second half of the course. Calm start for the V4 races, which eventually shifted to very strong cross headwind for the last 750.
Comments: Race order 2&#45;4&#45;1&#45;3 to accommodate a Groton hot seat between 2/3. V4 race started 1.5 lengths over the line; 2V4 race 1 length over the line. In the 4V4 race, Groton caught a boat&#45;stopping crab with 400m to go. Before the crab, race order was solidly SM, Groton, MX.
