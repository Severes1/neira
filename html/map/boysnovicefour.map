Distance: 1500
Conditions: Floating starts with moderate head winds early in the races but dying as the afternoon went on. It was against the current.
Comments: The crews launched 6K from the start so hot seating was challenging but done. Dexter 2v hot seated a rower from 5v. 2 rowers from Dexter 1v finished and then raced in the 2v due to illness and injury. Dexter 4v raced without a skeg. Hopkins protested the 1V as Brunswick crossed into their lane around 750 and gave them rougher waters to row. Overall it was great race conditions and a great day of close races. Races were rowed in the order listed and alternated male and female." alt="" coords="76,54,76,127,71,127,71,54"/>

Distance: 1500
Conditions: 7&#45;9 mph headwind. Little current, but heavy chop for the first three races (GN, B2V, BN and B3V). Moderate chop for the last three events (G2V, G1V and B1V)
Comments: In the boys 1V race, Dexter impeded Dublin. This was caused by the drifting of the 500m buoy from lanes 3/4 to lanes 2/3. Dublin lodged a protest at the finish. It was decided that it was inconclusive as to whether the order of finish would have been impacted. Dexter agreed to forfeit the Boys Varsity trophy." alt="" coords="76,190,76,263,71,263,71,190"/>
