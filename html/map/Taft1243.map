Submitted by Melissa Schomers.
Distance: 1500m
Conditions: Good racing conditions, though it was challenging for coxes at the starting line. Winds out of the SW at 5&#45;10mph, creating a cross&#45;tail wind from lane 6 to lane 1. Some crews had trouble locking on, but overall, crews did an excellent job in the conditions.
Congratulations to Taft for winning the Smith cup with their win in the B1V4 event.
