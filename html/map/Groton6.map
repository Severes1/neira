Submitted by Andy Anderson.
Distance: 1225 meters
Conditions: Perfect water.No wind.
Comments: Girls 6th boat race had a false start with Groton crashing into a tree branch. Two girls had superficial injuries and were substituted for. Their race started at least two lengths over the line. I added 10 seconds to their times, so they are not entirely accurate.
Very good racing up and down the schedule. Very good sportsmanship. Fun JV regatta." alt="" coords="64,53,69,84,81,116,95,134,91,137,76,119,63,86,58,54"/>
