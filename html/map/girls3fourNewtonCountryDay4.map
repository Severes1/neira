Distance: 1350m
Conditions: Head current, tailwind for all races.
Comments: Race order 2, 1, 3/4. 
In the 1st boat race, Southfields stroke seats oar popped out of its oarlock 2:54 into the race. At that point, NCDS was up by 2 seats. After approx. 5 recovery time, Southfield came back and rowed an aggressive, tenacious race to the finish.
Thank you to Southfield for a great afternoon of early season racing on the Charles!" alt="" coords="125,190,125,263,120,263,120,190"/>
