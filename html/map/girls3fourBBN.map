Submitted by Liz Cavanaugh.
Distance: 1500m
Conditions: Considerable NE cross/tail, variable conditions throughout the afternoon. Conditions choppy, particularly in the last 750m of the course.
Comments: Race order 4&#45;2&#45;3&#45;1. 2V4 race was restarted after collision of two crews within the first 30 sec of race. 3V4 race started 2 lengths over the line, V4 race a little more than 1 length over the line. Given messy conditions at starting line, a really great job by all coxswains handling the starts. Thank you to all visiting crews for coming out today!" alt="" coords="229,186,103,275,99,270,226,182"/>

Submitted by Kate Spelman.
Distance: 1300m
Conditions: Beautiful flat water for all races (despite some pre&#45;race downpours!).
Comments: A great day of late&#45;afternoon racing on the Charles! Strong racing from all crews. 
Race order 1&#45;4&#45;3&#45;2 to accommodate hot seating a Middlesex 2V athlete into the 1V race. 
Special thanks to Chris Richards and Belmont Hill for lending us their buoys and stakes to help set up the course!" alt="" coords="255,190,255,263,250,263,250,190"/>
