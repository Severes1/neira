Submitted by Melissa Schomers.
Distance: 1500m
Conditions: Good racing conditions, though it was challenging for coxes at the starting line. Winds out of the SW at 5&#45;10mph, creating a cross&#45;tail wind from lane 6 to lane 1. Some crews had trouble locking on, but overall, crews did an excellent job in the conditions.
Congratulations to Taft for winning the Smith cup with their win in the B1V4 event.

Submitted by Andrew Bagley.
Distance: 1500m
Conditions: Considerable NE cross/tail, variable conditions through the afternoon. Conditions choppy, particularly in the last 750m of the course.
Comments: Race order 2&#45;3/4&#45;1. 3V/4V race was started 3 lengths over the line due to the considerable winds causing the boats to drift past. 2V/1V races all started at the 1500m mark. Well done coxswains for handling the difficult conditions and thank you to all visiting schools for joining!" alt="" coords="846,54,837,87,818,119,793,139,790,135,814,116,832,85,840,53"/>
