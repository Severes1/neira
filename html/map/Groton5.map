Conditions: Perfect water.No wind.
Comments: Girls 6th boat race had a false start with Groton crashing into a tree branch. Two girls had superficial injuries and were substituted for. Their race started at least two lengths over the line. I added 10 seconds to their times, so they are not entirely accurate.
Very good racing up and down the schedule. Very good sportsmanship. Fun JV regatta." alt="" coords="396,41,358,55,340,66,325,79,312,102,306,128,301,127,307,100,321,76,337,61,356,50,394,36"/>
