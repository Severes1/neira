Distance: 1650
Conditions: 1&#45;6 HS girls fours event. Perfect conditions. Floating start. 10&#45;15 minute centers. Start to finish was estimated to be 1650 meters total.
Comments: *Note: Miss Porterâs 3V was late to the start for this race, but we wanted to ensure a racing opportunity for them. We were able to accommodate them in the 6V event.
