Comments: Note: Pomfrets 4th boat shell was in the repair shop for the entire season and returned the morning of this regatta. This 4th boat crew had never raced before and didnt have more than 2 days on the water. They didnt have a start, were capped at a 26, and caught one crab during the last 250 meters.

Distance: 1500m
Conditions: Variable crosswind that changed both speed and direction throughout the course of the afternoon and opened up even more in the second half of the course. Calm start for the V4 races, which eventually shifted to very strong cross headwind for the last 750.

Conditions: Floating starts with moderate head winds early in the races but dying as the afternoon went on. It was against the current.
Comments: The start was 6K away from the dock which made hot seating challenging but doable. GA hot seated a rower from GV4 to GV3 . A time wasnt recorded for Greenwich A in GV4." alt="" coords="1483,190,1483,263,1477,263,1477,190"/>

Comments: Thanks to L/OL for making the trip, and to LHRC and Forman for joining our annual opening race.
There was a bang&#45;bang finish between the G2 finishers Taft and GA. Very hard to tell even from photos, but it was determined that Taft was on the drive across the finish and nosed ahead.

Conditions: Conditions were pretty good. Winds out of the SW at 5&#45;7 mph, creating a crosstail from lanes 6 to lane 1. Coxes had some trouble staying in lanes at the start, but overall rowers handled the conditions very well. Racing order: 4&#45;3&#45;2&#45;1&#45;5.
Congratulations to Taft for winning the Alumni Cup with 6 points, winning the tie over The Gunnery with a win in the G1V4.

Distance: 1500
Conditions: Mostly cloudy. High 63F. Winds S/SSE at 10&#45;15 mph. Winds shifted during the day and picked up to provide a decent tailwind as the races progressed. Thanks to all visiting teams who made the drive and helped with traffic flow on both water and land.
Comments: Race Order: G4, G2, G1, G3, G5/6
G1: Stronger tailwind
G2: mild tailwind
G3: stronger tailwind/cross wind; delayed start with lane mixing. Started 30 meters ahead of starting line
G4: mild wind
G5 (Taft vs. Deerfield): Times were lost post regatta. Memory based on trailing launch who recalled Taft winning by approx 20 seconds. 
G5/6: Last race of the day; started 100 meters ahead of the starting line, after oars clashed and we held re&#45;start from that spot." alt="" coords="2928,734,2912,988,2899,1127,2892,1177,2884,1206,2869,1233,2852,1251,2805,1280,2735,1306,2641,1328,2528,1346,2406,1360,2164,1379,1976,1388,1975,1383,2163,1374,2406,1354,2527,1340,2640,1322,2734,1301,2803,1275,2849,1247,2864,1230,2879,1204,2886,1176,2894,1126,2907,987,2923,733"/>
