Distance: 1500m
Conditions: Variable crosswind that changed both speed and direction throughout the course of the afternoon and opened up even more in the second half of the course. Calm start for the V4 races, which eventually shifted to very strong cross headwind for the last 750.
Comments: Race order 2&#45;4&#45;1&#45;3 to accommodate a Groton hot seat between 2/3. V4 race started 1.5 lengths over the line; 2V4 race 1 length over the line. In the 4V4 race, Groton caught a boat&#45;stopping crab with 400m to go. Before the crab, race order was solidly SM, Groton, MX.

Conditions: Beautiful day! Mid 60s, sunny, slight tailwind, 8&#45;10 mph, some sporadic cross wind. Girls 5th and 4th boat heat started a boat length ahead of the starting line.
Comments: Note: Pomfrets 4th boat shell was in the repair shop for the entire season and returned the morning of this regatta. This 4th boat crew had never raced before and didnt have more than 2 days on the water. They didnt have a start, were capped at a 26, and caught one crab during the last 250 meters.

Comments: Race Order: G4, G2, G1, G3, G5/6
G1: Stronger tailwind
G2: mild tailwind
G3: stronger tailwind/cross wind; delayed start with lane mixing. Started 30 meters ahead of starting line
G4: mild wind
G5 (Taft vs. Deerfield): Times were lost post regatta. Memory based on trailing launch who recalled Taft winning by approx 20 seconds.

Conditions: 15mph headwind with some chop in the first half, increaing in intensity over the course of the afternoon. Order of racing was 4, 3, 2, 1, 5 with best conditions for the first two races.
Comments: Choate 4 and 5 raced Lincolns 4th boat, and Choate 6 and 7 raced Lincolns 5th boat. Choate 7 caught a boat&#45;stopping crab at 500m into the race. It took about 30 seconds to recover the oar and to turn the boat back to the correct direction.

Distance: 1500m
Conditions: Winds out of the SE, variable from 4&#45;8mph, creating a cross tailwind from lane 1 to lane 6. Floating starts in the tailwind did mean that some events werent precisely 1500m, but all races were started very near the start line (5&#45;10m variable between races).
Thanks to all crews for racing and giving us a great season ender at The Gunnery! We look forward to seeing you next year on Lake Waramaug!

Conditions: Considerable NE cross/tail, variable conditions throughout the afternoon. Conditions choppy, particularly in the last 750m of the course.

Conditions: Mostly cloudy. High 63F. Winds S/SSE at 10&#45;15 mph. Winds shifted during the day and picked up to provide a decent tailwind as the races progressed. Thanks to all visiting teams who made the drive and helped with traffic flow on both water and land.
Comments: Race Order: G4, G2, G1, G3, G5/6
G1: Stronger tailwind
G2: mild tailwind
G3: stronger tailwind/cross wind; delayed start with lane mixing. Started 30 meters ahead of starting line
G4: mild wind
G5 (Taft vs. Deerfield): Times were lost post regatta. Memory based on trailing launch who recalled Taft winning by approx 20 seconds.
