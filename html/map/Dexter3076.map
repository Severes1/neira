Submitted by Pomfret coaching staff.
Distance: 1,500 Meters
Conditions: Near ideal conditions: barely a breeze with flat water for early races, switching to a stronger cross&#45;tailwind with very light chop for the B4 on. No current. Partly sunny.
Comments: Races alternated with girls races. Order of racing: 2:30 start, B5&#45;G4&#45;B6&#45;G2&#45;B2&#45;G1&#45;B3&#45;G3&#45;B4&#45;G5&#45;B1&#45;G6 on 10&#45;minute centers, ending at 4:40 pm. Winds shifted most noticeably with the G3 race at 3:40 pm.

&#45; B4: 30 meters over, ~1470 m total.
&#45; B1: 10 meters over, ~1490 m total.
