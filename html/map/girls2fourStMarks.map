Distance: 1500m
Conditions: Considerable NE cross/tail, variable conditions throughout the afternoon. Conditions choppy, particularly in the last 750m of the course.
Comments: Race order 4&#45;2&#45;3&#45;1. 2V4 race was restarted after collision of two crews within the first 30 sec of race. 3V4 race started 2 lengths over the line, V4 race a little more than 1 length over the line. Given messy conditions at starting line, a really great job by all coxswains handling the starts.
