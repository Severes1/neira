Distance: 1500m
Conditions: Conditions were pretty good. Winds out of the SW at 5&#45;7 mph, creating a crosstail from lanes 6 to lane 1. Coxes had some trouble staying in lanes at the start, but overall rowers handled the conditions very well. Racing order: 4&#45;3&#45;2&#45;1&#45;5.
Congratulations to Taft for winning the Alumni Cup with 6 points, winning the tie over The Gunnery with a win in the G1V4.
