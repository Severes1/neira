Distance: 1500m
Conditions: Aggressive cross&#45;tailwind; conditions opened up in the last 750 causing moderate chop.
Comments: Race order 4&#45;2&#45;3&#45;1. V4 and 2V4 started 1 length over the line. Cross/tail caused some significant issues and delays in starts; restart in the 3V4 race. Thank you to visiting crews for coming out on a late Wednesday!" alt="" coords="83,50,164,131,160,135,79,54"/>
