Submitted by Adam Holland.
Distance: 1250m
Conditions: Strong cross tail wind from port for all races. Varying in intensity, but always quite strong, Reasonably calm water at start, choppier closer to finish line.
Comments: The 3rd boat race was started with the sterns aligned on the starting line.
