Submitted by Paul MacKenzie.
Distance: 1500 M
Conditions: 15&#45;20 mph steady headwind gusting higher. Whitecaps for first 750 M of race course.
Comments: In the 6/7 race, Taft 7 suffered a couple of jumped slides in the second 500 as well as a loose foot stretcher they stopped to adjust. Also in that race, each Taft boat stopped a couple of strokes short of the finish line.
Thanks to Choate coaches for helping out with aligning/starting, and to all coaches and rowers for their patience dealing with some challenging conditions." alt="" coords="79,51,134,116,149,131,145,135,130,119,75,54"/>
