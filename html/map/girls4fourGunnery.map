Conditions: Conditions were pretty good. Winds out of the SW at 5&#45;7 mph, creating a crosstail from lanes 6 to lane 1. Coxes had some trouble staying in lanes at the start, but overall rowers handled the conditions very well. Racing order: 4&#45;3&#45;2&#45;1&#45;5.
Congratulations to Taft for winning the Alumni Cup with 6 points, winning the tie over The Gunnery with a win in the G1V4.

Submitted by Katy Varga, The Gunnery.
Distance: 1650
Conditions: 1&#45;6 HS girls fours event. Perfect conditions. Floating start. 10&#45;15 minute centers. Start to finish was estimated to be 1650 meters total.
Comments: *Note: Miss Porterâs 3V was late to the start for this race, but we wanted to ensure a racing opportunity for them. We were able to accommodate them in the 6V event. 
Much thanks to all of the coaches for helping run a smooth regatta, and congratulations to Greenwich Academy for taking home the cup at the end of the day!" alt="" coords="1027,54,889,120,816,148,814,143,887,115,1025,49"/>

Submitted by Liz Cavanaugh.
Distance: 1500m
Conditions: Considerable NE cross/tail, variable conditions throughout the afternoon. Conditions choppy, particularly in the last 750m of the course.
Comments: Race order 4&#45;2&#45;3&#45;1. 2V4 race was restarted after collision of two crews within the first 30 sec of race. 3V4 race started 2 lengths over the line, V4 race a little more than 1 length over the line. Given messy conditions at starting line, a really great job by all coxswains handling the starts. Thank you to all visiting crews for coming out today!" alt="" coords="1038,277,1033,245,1026,229,1016,215,985,199,937,187,827,173,828,168,938,182,987,194,1019,211,1030,226,1038,243,1043,277"/>
