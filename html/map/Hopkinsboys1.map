Submitted by Sarah Bednar.
Distance: 1500
Conditions: Floating starts with moderate head winds early in the races but dying as the afternoon went on. It was against the current.
Comments: The crews launched 6K from the start so hot seating was challenging but done. Dexter 2v hot seated a rower from 5v. 2 rowers from Dexter 1v finished and then raced in the 2v due to illness and injury. Dexter 4v raced without a skeg. Hopkins protested the 1V as Brunswick crossed into their lane around 750 and gave them rougher waters to row. Overall it was great race conditions and a great day of close races. Races were rowed in the order listed and alternated male and female." alt="" coords="57,53,59,86,65,102,74,115,104,132,152,144,263,158,263,163,151,149,102,137,70,119,60,104,54,87,52,54"/>
