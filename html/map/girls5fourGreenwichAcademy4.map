Distance: 1500 M
Conditions: Cloudy, warm, moderate tailwind of 10&#45;12 mph that diminished by final race. Moderate chop for first three races, less for final race. Order of racing: 3&#45;2&#45;1&#45;4/5.
Comments: Berkshire doubled two rowers from 3V to 4V. Thanks to Greenwich for traveling and to the 1V and 2V girls for staying out to do a couple of 2 min. pieces after the racing." alt="" coords="127,54,127,127,121,127,121,54"/>
