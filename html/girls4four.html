Submitted by Liz Cavanaugh.
Distance: 1500m
Conditions: Variable crosswind that changed both speed and direction throughout the course of the afternoon and opened up even more in the second half of the course. Calm start for the V4 races, which eventually shifted to very strong cross headwind for the last 750.
Comments: Race order 2-4-1-3 to accommodate a Groton hot seat between 2/3. V4 race started 1.5 lengths over the line; 2V4 race 1 length over the line. In the 4V4 race, Groton caught a boat-stopping crab with 400m to go. Before the crab, race order was solidly SM, Groton, MX. Thanks to all crews for a great day of racing!">

Submitted by Pomfret School .
Distance: 1500
Conditions: Beautiful day! Mid 60s, sunny, slight tailwind, 8-10 mph, some sporadic cross wind. Girls 5th and 4th boat heat started a boat length ahead of the starting line.
Comments: Note: Pomfrets 4th boat shell was in the repair shop for the entire season and returned the morning of this regatta. This 4th boat crew had never raced before and didnt have more than 2 days on the water. They didnt have a start, were capped at a 26, and caught one crab during the last 250 meters. Soon, the 4th will be faster than the 5th, but they need more water time.">

Comments: Race order 4-2-3-1. 2V4 race was restarted after collision of two crews within the first 30 sec of race. 3V4 race started 2 lengths over the line, V4 race a little more than 1 length over the line.

Conditions: Variable crosswind that changed both speed and direction throughout the course of the afternoon and opened up even more in the second half of the course. Calm start for the V4 races, which eventually shifted to very strong cross headwind for the last 750.
Comments: Race order 2-4-1-3 to accommodate a Groton hot seat between 2/3. V4 race started 1.5 lengths over the line; 2V4 race 1 length over the line. In the 4V4 race, Groton caught a boat-stopping crab with 400m to go. Before the crab, race order was solidly SM, Groton, MX. Thanks to all crews for a great day of racing!">

Conditions: Considerable NE cross/tail, variable conditions throughout the afternoon. Conditions choppy, particularly in the last 750m of the course.
Comments: Race order 4-2-3-1. 2V4 race was restarted after collision of two crews within the first 30 sec of race. 3V4 race started 2 lengths over the line, V4 race a little more than 1 length over the line. Given messy conditions at starting line, a really great job by all coxswains handling the starts. Thank you to all visiting crews for coming out today!">

Conditions: Considerable NE cross/tail, variable conditions throughout the afternoon. Conditions choppy, particularly in the last 750m of the course.
Comments: Race order 4-2-3-1. 2V4 race was restarted after collision of two crews within the first 30 sec of race. 3V4 race started 2 lengths over the line, V4 race a little more than 1 length over the line.

Distance: 1500m
Conditions: Variable (light) cross headwind. Mostly calm and flat water at the start, and slight chop in the last 750. 2V race had more of a headwind at the start than other races.
Comments: Combined 3V and 4V races, order 2-3/4-1. A couple of wakes from neighboring Quinsigamond coaches which slightly interfered with racing, however, did not affect finish order of any races. All crews right on the 1500m starting line. Thank you to Lincoln for a great day of racing!">

There was a bang-bang finish between the G2 finishers Taft and GA. Very hard to tell even from photos, but it was determined that Taft was on the drive across the finish and nosed ahead.

Comments: Choate 4 and 5 raced Lincolns 4th boat, and Choate 6 and 7 raced Lincolns 5th boat. Choate 7 caught a boat-stopping crab at 500m into the race. It took about 30 seconds to recover the oar and to turn the boat back to the correct direction. Before the crab, Choate 7 was trailing Lincoln 5 and Choate 6 by about half a length.">

Comments: In the 6/7 race, Taft 7 suffered a couple of jumped slides in the second 500 as well as a loose foot stretcher they stopped to adjust. Also in that race, each Taft boat stopped a couple of strokes short of the finish line.

In the 1st boat race, Southfields stroke seats oar popped out of its oarlock 2:54 into the race. At that point, NCDS was up by 2 seats. After approx. 5 recovery time, Southfield came back and rowed an aggressive, tenacious race to the finish.

Distance: 1500
Conditions: 10 mph NNE headwind for all races. Headwind for the first 500. Straight cross wind for the middle 500 that slowed some crews down. Lighter headwind for the final 500 -- ideal finishing conditions.
Comments: Thanks to L/OL for making the trip, and to LHRC and Forman for joining our annual opening race.
There was a bang-bang finish between the G2 finishers Taft and GA. Very hard to tell even from photos, but it was determined that Taft was on the drive across the finish and nosed ahead.
Valley did not have complete boats, so they raced where we believed appropriate, but these races will not count for NEIRA qualifying">

Submitted by Melissa Schomers.
Distance: 1500m
Conditions: Conditions were pretty good. Winds out of the SW at 5-7 mph, creating a crosstail from lanes 6 to lane 1. Coxes had some trouble staying in lanes at the start, but overall rowers handled the conditions very well. Racing order: 4-3-2-1-5.
Congratulations to Taft for winning the Alumni Cup with 6 points, winning the tie over The Gunnery with a win in the G1V4.

Comments: In the 6/7 race, Taft 7 suffered a couple of jumped slides in the second 500 as well as a loose foot stretcher they stopped to adjust. Also in that race, each Taft boat stopped a couple of strokes short of the finish line.

Conditions: Variable crosswind that changed both speed and direction throughout the course of the afternoon and opened up even more in the second half of the course. Calm start for the V4 races, which eventually shifted to very strong cross headwind for the last 750.
Comments: Race order 2-4-1-3 to accommodate a Groton hot seat between 2/3. V4 race started 1.5 lengths over the line; 2V4 race 1 length over the line.
