Distance: 1,500 Meters
Conditions: Near ideal conditions: barely a breeze with flat water for early races, switching to a stronger cross-tailwind with very light chop for the B4 on. No current. Partly sunny.
Comments: Races alternated with girls races. Order of racing: 2:30 start, B5-G4-B6-G2-B2-G1-B3-G3-B4-G5-B1-G6 on 10-minute centers, ending at 4:40 pm. Winds shifted most noticeably with the G3 race at 3:40 pm.
Due to the sudden shift to a light/moderate tailwind, the following races started over the line by the following distance: 
- B4: 30 meters over, ~1470 m total.
- B1: 10 meters over, ~1490 m total.
Due to illness, Taft raced a 1, 2, 3, and 5 boat.">

Comments: The crews launched 6K from the start so hot seating was challenging but done. Dexter 2v hot seated a rower from 5v. 2 rowers from Dexter 1v finished and then raced in the 2v due to illness and injury. Dexter 4v raced without a skeg.

Distance: 1500
Conditions: 7-9 mph headwind. Little current, but heavy chop for the first three races (GN, B2V, BN and B3V). Moderate chop for the last three events (G2V, G1V and B1V)
Comments: In the boys 1V race, Dexter impeded Dublin. This was caused by the drifting of the 500m buoy from lanes 3/4 to lanes 2/3. Dublin lodged a protest at the finish. It was decided that it was inconclusive as to whether the order of finish would have been impacted. Dexter agreed to forfeit the Boys Varsity trophy.">

Distance: 1500m
Conditions: Good racing conditions, though it was challenging for coxes at the starting line. Winds out of the SW at 5-10mph, creating a cross-tail wind from lane 6 to lane 1. Some crews had trouble locking on, but overall, crews did an excellent job in the conditions.
Congratulations to Taft for winning the Smith cup with their win in the B1V4 event.

Distance: 1500m
Conditions: Good racing conditions, though it was challenging for coxes at the starting line. Winds out of the SW at 5-10mph, creating a cross-tail wind from lane 6 to lane 1. Some crews had trouble locking on, but overall, crews did an excellent job in the conditions.
Congratulations to Taft for winning the Smith cup with their win in the B1V4 event.

Distance: 1500m
Conditions: Solid cross wind in the first 750 that swung to a cross headwind in the second 750. Wind strength was variable. Tail current. Some crews started on the line and others slightly over. Times should not be compared between events. Order of racing - 5V, 6V, 3V, 2V, 1V, 4V.
Comments: There was some great racing today on the Connecticut River. Thanks to Nobles, Middlesex, and Rumsey Hall for making the trip out to Northampton. And thank you to UMass and Northampton Community Rowing for helping us to host the event!">

Distance: 1500m
Conditions: Winds out of the SW, creating a cross-tail from lane 1 to lane 6. Floating starts. Tailwind shifted the distance for some events as they drifted past the starting line, but all crews started within 5-15m of the start. A faulty stopwatch resulted in time not being taken for the Gunnery 3V4, but it is estimated they finished 20-30 seconds behind the 3rd place crew.
Thanks to all crews for racing us on our season ender at Lake Waramaug! We look forward to seeing everyone again next year!

Dexter 2v hot seated a rower from 5v. 2 rowers from Dexter 1v finished and then raced in the 2v due to illness and injury. Dexter 4v raced without a skeg.

Conditions: Good racing conditions, though it was challenging for coxes at the starting line. Winds out of the SW at 5-10mph, creating a cross-tail wind from lane 6 to lane 1. Some crews had trouble locking on, but overall, crews did an excellent job in the conditions.

Distance: 1500m
Conditions: Considerable NE cross/tail, variable conditions through the afternoon. Conditions choppy, particularly in the last 750m of the course.
Comments: Race order 2-3/4-1. 3V/4V race was started 3 lengths over the line due to the considerable winds causing the boats to drift past. 2V/1V races all started at the 1500m mark. Well done coxswains for handling the difficult conditions and thank you to all visiting schools for joining!">

Distance: 1,500 Meters
Conditions: Near ideal conditions: barely a breeze with flat water for early races, switching to a stronger cross-tailwind with very light chop for the B4 on. No current. Partly sunny.
Comments: Races alternated with girls races. Order of racing: 2:30 start, B5-G4-B6-G2-B2-G1-B3-G3-B4-G5-B1-G6 on 10-minute centers, ending at 4:40 pm. Winds shifted most noticeably with the G3 race at 3:40 pm.
Due to the sudden shift to a light/moderate tailwind, the following races started over the line by the following distance: 
- B4: 30 meters over, ~1470 m total.
- B1: 10 meters over, ~1490 m total.
Due to illness, Taft raced a 1, 2, 3, and 5 boat.">

Conditions: Good racing conditions, though it was challenging for coxes at the starting line. Winds out of the SW at 5-10mph, creating a cross-tail wind from lane 6 to lane 1. Some crews had trouble locking on, but overall, crews did an excellent job in the conditions.

Distance: 1500m
Conditions: Good racing conditions, though it was challenging for coxes at the starting line. Winds out of the SW at 5-10mph, creating a cross-tail wind from lane 6 to lane 1. Some crews had trouble locking on, but overall, crews did an excellent job in the conditions.
Congratulations to Taft for winning the Smith cup with their win in the B1V4 event.
