Conditions: Beautiful day! Mid 60s, sunny, slight tailwind, 8-10 mph, some sporadic cross wind. Girls 5th and 4th boat heat started a boat length ahead of the starting line.
Comments: Note: Pomfrets 4th boat shell was in the repair shop for the entire season and returned the morning of this regatta. This 4th boat crew had never raced before and didnt have more than 2 days on the water. They didnt have a start, were capped at a 26, and caught one crab during the last 250 meters. Soon, the 4th will be faster than the 5th, but they need more water time.">

Submitted by Liz Cavanaugh.
Distance: 1500m
Conditions: Variable (light) cross headwind. Mostly calm and flat water at the start, and slight chop in the last 750. 2V race had more of a headwind at the start than other races.
Comments: Combined 3V and 4V races, order 2-3/4-1. A couple of wakes from neighboring Quinsigamond coaches which slightly interfered with racing, however, did not affect finish order of any races. All crews right on the 1500m starting line. Thank you to Lincoln for a great day of racing!">
