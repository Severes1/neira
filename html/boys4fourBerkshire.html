Submitted by Melissa Schomers.
Distance: 1500m
Conditions: Good racing conditions, though it was challenging for coxes at the starting line. Winds out of the SW at 5-10mph, creating a cross-tail wind from lane 6 to lane 1. Some crews had trouble locking on, but overall, crews did an excellent job in the conditions.
Congratulations to Taft for winning the Smith cup with their win in the B1V4 event.

Submitted by Sarah Bednar.
Distance: 1500
Conditions: Floating starts with moderate head winds early in the races but dying as the afternoon went on. It was against the current.
Comments: The crews launched 6K from the start so hot seating was challenging but done. Dexter 2v hot seated a rower from 5v. 2 rowers from Dexter 1v finished and then raced in the 2v due to illness and injury. Dexter 4v raced without a skeg. Hopkins protested the 1V as Brunswick crossed into their lane around 750 and gave them rougher waters to row. Overall it was great race conditions and a great day of close races. Races were rowed in the order listed and alternated male and female.">
