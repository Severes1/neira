Submitted by Pomfret School .
Distance: 1500
Conditions: Beautiful day! Mid 60s, sunny, slight tailwind, 8-10 mph, some sporadic cross wind. Girls 5th and 4th boat heat started a boat length ahead of the starting line.
Comments: Note: Pomfrets 4th boat shell was in the repair shop for the entire season and returned the morning of this regatta. This 4th boat crew had never raced before and didnt have more than 2 days on the water. They didnt have a start, were capped at a 26, and caught one crab during the last 250 meters. Soon, the 4th will be faster than the 5th, but they need more water time.">

Conditions: Floating starts with moderate head winds early in the races but dying as the afternoon went on. It was against the current.
Comments: The start was 6K away from the dock which made hot seating challenging but doable. GA hot seated a rower from GV4 to GV3 . A time wasnt recorded for Greenwich A in GV4.">

Submitted by Melissa Schomers.
Distance: 1500m
Conditions: Conditions were pretty good. Winds out of the SW at 5-7 mph, creating a crosstail from lanes 6 to lane 1. Coxes had some trouble staying in lanes at the start, but overall rowers handled the conditions very well. Racing order: 4-3-2-1-5.
Congratulations to Taft for winning the Alumni Cup with 6 points, winning the tie over The Gunnery with a win in the G1V4.
