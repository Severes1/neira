Submitted by Pomfret School .
Distance: 1500
Conditions: Mostly cloudy. High 63F. Winds S/SSE at 10-15 mph. Winds shifted during the day and picked up to provide a decent tailwind as the races progressed. Thanks to all visiting teams who made the drive and helped with traffic flow on both water and land.
Comments: Race Order: G4, G2, G1, G3, G5/6
G1: Stronger tailwind
G2: mild tailwind
G3: stronger tailwind/cross wind; delayed start with lane mixing. Started 30 meters ahead of starting line
G4: mild wind
G5 (Taft vs. Deerfield): Times were lost post regatta. Memory based on trailing launch who recalled Taft winning by approx 20 seconds. 
G5/6: Last race of the day; started 100 meters ahead of the starting line, after oars clashed and we held re-start from that spot.">
