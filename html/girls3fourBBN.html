Submitted by Liz Cavanaugh.
Distance: 1500m
Conditions: Considerable NE cross/tail, variable conditions throughout the afternoon. Conditions choppy, particularly in the last 750m of the course.
Comments: Race order 4-2-3-1. 2V4 race was restarted after collision of two crews within the first 30 sec of race. 3V4 race started 2 lengths over the line, V4 race a little more than 1 length over the line. Given messy conditions at starting line, a really great job by all coxswains handling the starts. Thank you to all visiting crews for coming out today!">

Conditions: Beautiful flat water for all races (despite some pre-race downpours!).
Comments: A great day of late-afternoon racing on the Charles! Strong racing from all crews. 
Race order 1-4-3-2 to accommodate hot seating a Middlesex 2V athlete into the 1V race. 
Special thanks to Chris Richards and Belmont Hill for lending us their buoys and stakes to help set up the course!">
