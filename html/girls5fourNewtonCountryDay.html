Distance: 1650
Conditions: 1-6 HS girls fours event. Perfect conditions. Floating start. 10-15 minute centers. Start to finish was estimated to be 1650 meters total.
Comments: *Note: Miss Porterâs 3V was late to the start for this race, but we wanted to ensure a racing opportunity for them. We were able to accommodate them in the 6V event. 
Much thanks to all of the coaches for helping run a smooth regatta, and congratulations to Greenwich Academy for taking home the cup at the end of the day!">
