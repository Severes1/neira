Submitted by Melissa Schomers.
Distance: 1500m
Conditions: Conditions were pretty good. Winds out of the SW at 5-7 mph, creating a crosstail from lanes 6 to lane 1. Coxes had some trouble staying in lanes at the start, but overall rowers handled the conditions very well. Racing order: 4-3-2-1-5.
Congratulations to Taft for winning the Alumni Cup with 6 points, winning the tie over The Gunnery with a win in the G1V4.
