Submitted by Liz Cavanaugh.
Distance: 1500m
Conditions: Considerable NE cross/tail, variable conditions throughout the afternoon. Conditions choppy, particularly in the last 750m of the course.
Comments: Race order 4-2-3-1. 2V4 race was restarted after collision of two crews within the first 30 sec of race. 3V4 race started 2 lengths over the line, V4 race a little more than 1 length over the line. Given messy conditions at starting line, a really great job by all coxswains handling the starts. Thank you to all visiting crews for coming out today!">

Comments: Race Order: G4, G2, G1, G3, G5/6

G5 (Taft vs. Deerfield): Times were lost post regatta. Memory based on trailing launch who recalled Taft winning by approx 20 seconds.

Conditions: Steady tail current. No wind. Flat water. Gorgeous conditions.
Comments: Great racing, particularly in the 1V and 2V. Short pieces afterwards. Parents pooled awesome food as the two teams hung out and got to know each other afterwards. A great day of rowing, competition and friendship. Great thanks to UMass, Smith, Amherst and Northampton Community Rowing for making their amazing water available to us, and particularly to NCR and Todd Gocken for hosting.">

Conditions: Winds out of the SE, variable from 4-8mph, creating a cross tailwind from lane 1 to lane 6. Floating starts in the tailwind did mean that some events werent precisely 1500m, but all races were started very near the start line (5-10m variable between races).
