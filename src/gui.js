Comments: The crews launched 6K from the start so hot seating was challenging but done.

Distance: 1500m
Conditions: Winds out of the SW, creating a cross-tail from lane 1 to lane 6. Floating starts. Tailwind shifted the distance for some events as they drifted past the starting line, but all crews started within 5-15m of the start. A faulty stopwatch resulted in time not being taken for the Gunnery 3V4, but it is estimated they finished 20-30 seconds behind the 3rd place crew.
Thanks to all crews for racing us on our season ender at Lake Waramaug! We look forward to seeing everyone again next year!

Comments: The crews launched 6K from the start so hot seating was challenging but done.

Hopkins protested the 1V as Brunswick crossed into their lane around 750 and gave them rougher waters to row. Overall it was great race conditions and a great day of close races.

Submitted by Melissa Schomers.
Distance: 1500m
Conditions: Winds out of the SW, creating a cross-tail from lane 1 to lane 6. Floating starts. Tailwind shifted the distance for some events as they drifted past the starting line, but all crews started within 5-15m of the start. A faulty stopwatch resulted in time not being taken for the Gunnery 3V4, but it is estimated they finished 20-30 seconds behind the 3rd place crew.

Submitted by Thom Collins.
Distance: 1500
Conditions: 7-9 mph headwind. Little current, but heavy chop for the first three races (GN, B2V, BN and B3V). Moderate chop for the last three events (G2V, G1V and B1V)
Comments: In the boys 1V race, Dexter impeded Dublin. This was caused by the drifting of the 500m buoy from lanes 3/4 to lanes 2/3. Dublin lodged a protest at the finish. It was decided that it was inconclusive as to whether the order of finish would have been impacted.

Conditions: Good racing conditions, though it was challenging for coxes at the starting line. Winds out of the SW at 5-10mph, creating a cross-tail wind from lane 6 to lane 1. Some crews had trouble locking on, but overall, crews did an excellent job in the conditions.
Congratulations to Taft for winning the Smith cup with their win in the B1V4 event.

Dexter 2v hot seated a rower from 5v. 2 rowers from Dexter 1v finished and then raced in the 2v due to illness and injury. Dexter 4v raced without a skeg. Hopkins protested the 1V as Brunswick crossed into their lane around 750 and gave them rougher waters to row. Overall it was great race conditions and a great day of close races. Races were rowed in the order listed and alternated male and female.", URL="http://www.row2k.com/results/resultspage.cfm?UID=F373F2B06A996B69E19E5181AB930DAC&cat=1", random="random"];

Comments: The crews launched 6K from the start so hot seating was challenging but done.

Winds varied throughout the racing from a blustery headwind for the first 300 meters to a moderate tailwind for the remainder of the course. The wind for the first boat race was a predominant tailwind. Comments: The most exciting race of the day was the boys 4th boat! The lead traded between Kent and St. Johns at least two different times with Kent edging ahead at the line by 1 foot!
The times of one race should not be compared to different races due to a floating start and the boats not all starting on the line. Some of the lower boats started up 150 meters downstream of the start. All the coxswains should be commended for their steering and handling of the difficult conditions.

East Lyme rowed their 3V in the Second boat race as Middletown had no 3V to race them. 3V has no seeding result.

04/08", weight="96", tooltip="NEIRA Boys Eights: Kent School vs. St. Johns Prep			
Distance: 1500 Conditions: There was a strong tail current due to flooding. Winds varied throughout the racing from a blustery headwind for the first 300 meters to a moderate tailwind for the remainder of the course. The wind for the first boat race was a predominant tailwind. Comments: The most exciting race of the day was the boys 4th boat! The lead traded between Kent and St. Johns at least two different times with Kent edging ahead at the line by 1 foot!
The times of one race should not be compared to different races due to a floating start and the boats not all starting on the line. Some of the lower boats started up 150 meters downstream of the start. All the coxswains should be commended for their steering and handling of the difficult conditions. Thanks to St. Johns for coming to Kent!

04/08", weight="96", tooltip="NEIRA Boys Eights: Kent School vs. St. Johns Prep			
Distance: 1500 Conditions: There was a strong tail current due to flooding. Winds varied throughout the racing from a blustery headwind for the first 300 meters to a moderate tailwind for the remainder of the course. The wind for the first boat race was a predominant tailwind. Comments: The most exciting race of the day was the boys 4th boat! The lead traded between Kent and St. Johns at least two different times with Kent edging ahead at the line by 1 foot!
The times of one race should not be compared to different races due to a floating start and the boats not all starting on the line. Some of the lower boats started up 150 meters downstream of the start. All the coxswains should be commended for their steering and handling of the difficult conditions. Thanks to St. Johns for coming to Kent!

The lead traded between Kent and St. Johns at least two different times with Kent edging ahead at the line by 1 foot!
The times of one race should not be compared to different races due to a floating start and the boats not all starting on the line.

Distance: 1500 Conditions: There was a strong tail current due to flooding. Winds varied throughout the racing from a blustery headwind for the first 300 meters to a moderate tailwind for the remainder of the course. The wind for the first boat race was a predominant tailwind. Comments: The most exciting race of the day was the boys 4th boat! The lead traded between Kent and St. Johns at least two different times with Kent edging ahead at the line by 1 foot!
The times of one race should not be compared to different races due to a floating start and the boats not all starting on the line. Some of the lower boats started up 150 meters downstream of the start. All the coxswains should be commended for their steering and handling of the difficult conditions. Thanks to St. Johns for coming to Kent!

Distance: 1500 Conditions: There was a strong tail current due to flooding. Winds varied throughout the racing from a blustery headwind for the first 300 meters to a moderate tailwind for the remainder of the course. The wind for the first boat race was a predominant tailwind. Comments: The most exciting race of the day was the boys 4th boat! The lead traded between Kent and St. Johns at least two different times with Kent edging ahead at the line by 1 foot!
The times of one race should not be compared to different races due to a floating start and the boats not all starting on the line. Some of the lower boats started up 150 meters downstream of the start. All the coxswains should be commended for their steering and handling of the difficult conditions.

Distance: 1500 Conditions: There was a strong tail current due to flooding. Winds varied throughout the racing from a blustery headwind for the first 300 meters to a moderate tailwind for the remainder of the course. The wind for the first boat race was a predominant tailwind. Comments: The most exciting race of the day was the boys 4th boat! The lead traded between Kent and St. Johns at least two different times with Kent edging ahead at the line by 1 foot!
The times of one race should not be compared to different races due to a floating start and the boats not all starting on the line. Some of the lower boats started up 150 meters downstream of the start. All the coxswains should be commended for their steering and handling of the difficult conditions. Thanks to St. Johns for coming to Kent!

Distance: 1375 meters Conditions: Beautiful, flat, windless lake water - new for MHS river folks! Comments: Boys 2nd Boat race was a scrimmage - should not be used for seeding. Boats were mixed levels. Beautiful day - wanted to give all kids chance to race.
East Lyme rowed their 3V in the Second boat race as Middletown had no 3V to race them. 3V has no seeding result.
Girls 2nd Boat race started 150 meters into race course...thus the appearance of faster times. Times should not be compared from race to race as there was variation in starting line.
Thank you East Lyme for flexibility as race location changed. Thank you to East Hampton Crew for making our race possible by allowing the use of the lake today!
Thanks to all and congrats on a great (and quick) day of racing!

04/08", weight="96", tooltip="NEIRA Boys Eights: Kent School vs. St. Johns Prep			
Distance: 1500 Conditions: There was a strong tail current due to flooding. Winds varied throughout the racing from a blustery headwind for the first 300 meters to a moderate tailwind for the remainder of the course. The wind for the first boat race was a predominant tailwind. Comments: The most exciting race of the day was the boys 4th boat! The lead traded between Kent and St. Johns at least two different times with Kent edging ahead at the line by 1 foot!
The times of one race should not be compared to different races due to a floating start and the boats not all starting on the line. Some of the lower boats started up 150 meters downstream of the start. All the coxswains should be commended for their steering and handling of the difficult conditions. Thanks to St. Johns for coming to Kent!

Thank you East Lyme for flexibility as race location changed. Thank you to East Hampton Crew for making our race possible by allowing the use of the lake today!
Thanks to all and congrats on a great (and quick) day of racing!

Distance: 1500 Conditions: There was a strong tail current due to flooding. Winds varied throughout the racing from a blustery headwind for the first 300 meters to a moderate tailwind for the remainder of the course. The wind for the first boat race was a predominant tailwind. Comments: The most exciting race of the day was the boys 4th boat! The lead traded between Kent and St. Johns at least two different times with Kent edging ahead at the line by 1 foot!
The times of one race should not be compared to different races due to a floating start and the boats not all starting on the line. Some of the lower boats started up 150 meters downstream of the start. All the coxswains should be commended for their steering and handling of the difficult conditions. Thanks to St. Johns for coming to Kent!

Distance: 1500 Conditions: There was a strong tail current due to flooding. Winds varied throughout the racing from a blustery headwind for the first 300 meters to a moderate tailwind for the remainder of the course. The wind for the first boat race was a predominant tailwind. Comments: The most exciting race of the day was the boys 4th boat! The lead traded between Kent and St. Johns at least two different times with Kent edging ahead at the line by 1 foot!
The times of one race should not be compared to different races due to a floating start and the boats not all starting on the line. Some of the lower boats started up 150 meters downstream of the start. All the coxswains should be commended for their steering and handling of the difficult conditions.

The lead traded between Kent and St. Johns at least two different times with Kent edging ahead at the line by 1 foot!
The times of one race should not be compared to different races due to a floating start and the boats not all starting on the line.

The wind for the first boat race was a predominant tailwind. Comments: The most exciting race of the day was the boys 4th boat! The lead traded between Kent and St. Johns at least two different times with Kent edging ahead at the line by 1 foot!
The times of one race should not be compared to different races due to a floating start and the boats not all starting on the line. Some of the lower boats started up 150 meters downstream of the start. All the coxswains should be commended for their steering and handling of the difficult conditions.

Some of the lower boats started up 150 meters downstream of the start. All the coxswains should be commended for their steering and handling of the difficult conditions. Thanks to St. Johns for coming to Kent!

The lead traded between Kent and St. Johns at least two different times with Kent edging ahead at the line by 1 foot!
The times of one race should not be compared to different races due to a floating start and the boats not all starting on the line.

Distance: 1500 Conditions: There was a strong tail current due to flooding. Winds varied throughout the racing from a blustery headwind for the first 300 meters to a moderate tailwind for the remainder of the course. The wind for the first boat race was a predominant tailwind. Comments: The most exciting race of the day was the boys 4th boat! The lead traded between Kent and St. Johns at least two different times with Kent edging ahead at the line by 1 foot!
The times of one race should not be compared to different races due to a floating start and the boats not all starting on the line. Some of the lower boats started up 150 meters downstream of the start. All the coxswains should be commended for their steering and handling of the difficult conditions. Thanks to St. Johns for coming to Kent!

04/08", weight="96", tooltip="NEIRA Boys Eights: Kent School vs. St. Johns Prep			
Distance: 1500 Conditions: There was a strong tail current due to flooding. Winds varied throughout the racing from a blustery headwind for the first 300 meters to a moderate tailwind for the remainder of the course. The wind for the first boat race was a predominant tailwind. Comments: The most exciting race of the day was the boys 4th boat! The lead traded between Kent and St. Johns at least two different times with Kent edging ahead at the line by 1 foot!
The times of one race should not be compared to different races due to a floating start and the boats not all starting on the line. Some of the lower boats started up 150 meters downstream of the start. All the coxswains should be commended for their steering and handling of the difficult conditions. Thanks to St. Johns for coming to Kent!

Thank you East Lyme for flexibility as race location changed. Thank you to East Hampton Crew for making our race possible by allowing the use of the lake today!
Thanks to all and congrats on a great (and quick) day of racing!

04/08", weight="96", tooltip="NEIRA Boys Eights: Kent School vs. St. Johns Prep			
Distance: 1500 Conditions: There was a strong tail current due to flooding. Winds varied throughout the racing from a blustery headwind for the first 300 meters to a moderate tailwind for the remainder of the course. The wind for the first boat race was a predominant tailwind. Comments: The most exciting race of the day was the boys 4th boat! The lead traded between Kent and St. Johns at least two different times with Kent edging ahead at the line by 1 foot!
The times of one race should not be compared to different races due to a floating start and the boats not all starting on the line. Some of the lower boats started up 150 meters downstream of the start. All the coxswains should be commended for their steering and handling of the difficult conditions. Thanks to St. Johns for coming to Kent!

Distance: 1500 Conditions: There was a strong tail current due to flooding. Winds varied throughout the racing from a blustery headwind for the first 300 meters to a moderate tailwind for the remainder of the course. The wind for the first boat race was a predominant tailwind. Comments: The most exciting race of the day was the boys 4th boat! The lead traded between Kent and St. Johns at least two different times with Kent edging ahead at the line by 1 foot!
The times of one race should not be compared to different races due to a floating start and the boats not all starting on the line. Some of the lower boats started up 150 meters downstream of the start. All the coxswains should be commended for their steering and handling of the difficult conditions. Thanks to St. Johns for coming to Kent!

The lead traded between Kent and St. Johns at least two different times with Kent edging ahead at the line by 1 foot!
The times of one race should not be compared to different races due to a floating start and the boats not all starting on the line.

Distance: 1500 Conditions: There was a strong tail current due to flooding. Winds varied throughout the racing from a blustery headwind for the first 300 meters to a moderate tailwind for the remainder of the course. The wind for the first boat race was a predominant tailwind. Comments: The most exciting race of the day was the boys 4th boat! The lead traded between Kent and St. Johns at least two different times with Kent edging ahead at the line by 1 foot!
The times of one race should not be compared to different races due to a floating start and the boats not all starting on the line. Some of the lower boats started up 150 meters downstream of the start. All the coxswains should be commended for their steering and handling of the difficult conditions. Thanks to St. Johns for coming to Kent!
