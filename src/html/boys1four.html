Distance: 1250m (approx) Comments: An alternate course was set up due to heavy wind. 15-20 mph tailwind and increasing chop throughout the course. Distances varied somewhat from race to race, so results between races should not be compared. Lower boats did not race. Thank you Dexter for making the early season trip north!
