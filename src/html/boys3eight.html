Distance: 1500 Conditions: There was a strong tail current due to flooding. Winds varied throughout the racing from a blustery headwind for the first 300 meters to a moderate tailwind for the remainder of the course. The wind for the first boat race was a predominant tailwind. Comments: The most exciting race of the day was the boys 4th boat! The lead traded between Kent and St. Johns at least two different times with Kent edging ahead at the line by 1 foot!
The times of one race should not be compared to different races due to a floating start and the boats not all starting on the line. Some of the lower boats started up 150 meters downstream of the start. All the coxswains should be commended for their steering and handling of the difficult conditions. Thanks to St. Johns for coming to Kent!
