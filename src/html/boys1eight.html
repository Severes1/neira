Distance: 1375 meters Conditions: Beautiful, flat, windless lake water - new for MHS river folks! Comments: Boys 2nd Boat race was a scrimmage - should not be used for seeding. Boats were mixed levels. Beautiful day - wanted to give all kids chance to race.
East Lyme rowed their 3V in the Second boat race as Middletown had no 3V to race them. 3V has no seeding result.
Girls 2nd Boat race started 150 meters into race course...thus the appearance of faster times. Times should not be compared from race to race as there was variation in starting line.
Thank you East Lyme for flexibility as race location changed. Thank you to East Hampton Crew for making our race possible by allowing the use of the lake today!
Thanks to all and congrats on a great (and quick) day of racing!

Distance: 1500 Conditions: There was a strong tail current due to flooding. Winds varied throughout the racing from a blustery headwind for the first 300 meters to a moderate tailwind for the remainder of the course. The wind for the first boat race was a predominant tailwind. Comments: The most exciting race of the day was the boys 4th boat! The lead traded between Kent and St. Johns at least two different times with Kent edging ahead at the line by 1 foot!
The times of one race should not be compared to different races due to a floating start and the boats not all starting on the line. Some of the lower boats started up 150 meters downstream of the start. All the coxswains should be commended for their steering and handling of the difficult conditions. Thanks to St. Johns for coming to Kent!

Distance: 1375 meters Conditions: Beautiful, flat, windless lake water - new for MHS river folks! Comments: Boys 2nd Boat race was a scrimmage - should not be used for seeding. Boats were mixed levels. Beautiful day - wanted to give all kids chance to race.
East Lyme rowed their 3V in the Second boat race as Middletown had no 3V to race them. 3V has no seeding result.
Girls 2nd Boat race started 150 meters into race course...thus the appearance of faster times. Times should not be compared from race to race as there was variation in starting line.
Thank you East Lyme for flexibility as race location changed. Thank you to East Hampton Crew for making our race possible by allowing the use of the lake today!
Thanks to all and congrats on a great (and quick) day of racing!
